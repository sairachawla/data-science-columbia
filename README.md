### Machine Learning:
- [HW2](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-columbia/tree/main/hw2): Part 1 focuses on a dataset for California schools test scores. I evaluate predicton errors using K Neighbors Regressor, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression. Furthermore, I tune parameters using GridSearchCV. Part 2 focuses on two datasets regarding red wine and white wine. I evaluate prediction error using K Neighbors Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Penalized Logistic Regression. Once again, I tune parameters using GridSearchCV. 

- [MT](): Focuses on the classification of spam emails using a spam dataset. I evaluate prediction errors using K Neighbors Classifier, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifiers, and Decision Trees. Furthermore, I tune parameters using GridSearchCV.
